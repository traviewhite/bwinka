        <h1>Mac Daddy's Identity<br/>& User Interface Design</h1>
        <p>This restaurant concept was an undergrad project that I decided to give a little facelift. Mac-and-cheese might be one of my favorite comfort foods, and I was trying to imagine if I could have a restaurant down the street from my houseâ€“ what would I want it to be like?
        New and fun? Yep. A little bit of an edge? Probably. Would there be cute illustrations of food I wanna eat everywhere? Absolutely.
